      Skunkworks is a guild for stellar players who can not or do not want to commit to the time-intensive raid schedules of traditional "hardcore" guilds. If you want to kill &#91;Expansion Endboss&#93;, but your newly acquired significant other doesn't understand that "lame fantasy thing you do," then we might be what you're looking for. We also are home to a number of people with school or work commitments that don't allow them to consider &lt;Paragon&gt; a viable option.  
      <BR /><BR />
      We raid Tuesdays and Thursdays from 9-1 CST, even after patch releases and during progression races. That's right, just 8 hours a week. We also run a very tight roster (28-30ish) with the expectation that our members achieve near 100% attendance.
      <BR /><BR />
      Loot is handled by /random with a "don't be a douche" clause, with a loot council for legendaries and key items.
      <BR /><BR />
      The guild was formed to take advantage of some of the "casual friendly" changes that were brought by WotLK, and we have successfully pushed the boundaries of what was previously considered possible on a limited raid schedule.
      <BR /><BR />
      Progression nuts and bolts can be had at <a href="http://www.wowprogress.com/guild/us/stormreaver/Skunkworks">WoW Progress</a>.

    <div class="aboutSubject">Who we expect you to be</div>    
      Applicants will only be considered if they demonstrate above-average intelligence, exemplary skill, a thorough understanding of game mechanics, maturity, a strong command of the English language, and a lack of epeening, douchebaggery, asshattery, and anything else that would make you unpleasant to be around. More than just good players, we're looking for people who we will enjoy killing pixels with, and we are just as likely to cut a trial for social reasons as we would for poor play (if not more so).
      <BR /><BR />
      If that sounds like what you're looking for, and you meet our admittedly high expectations, then we can unequivocally promise you that Skunkworks will be the best online nerd experience you will ever have the pleasure of being a part of.
